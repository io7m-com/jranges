## jranges

A set of functions and types for dealing with ranges and intervals.

## Features

* Immutable range types, for specifying ranges over all the available integral
  and floating point types.
* Functions for checking that values fall within given ranges.
* High coverage test suite.
* [OSGi-ready](https://www.osgi.org/)
* [JPMS-ready](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_Platform_Module_System)
* ISC license.

## Usage

### Range Checks

Use the `RangeCheck` class to perform range checks:

```
RangeCheck.checkIncludedInLong(
  23L,
  "Number of assignments",
  RangeInclusiveL.of(0L, 99),
  "Valid number of assignments"
);

RangeCheck.checkIncludedInLong(
  130L,
  "Number of assignments",
  RangeInclusiveL.of(0L, 99),
  "Valid number of assignments"
);
```

The second call will throw a `RangeCheckException` with a message similar to
`Range check failed: 0 <= Number of assignments (130) <= 99 (Valid number of assignments) == false`.

### Range Types

The package exposes numerous immutable half-open and inclusive range types,
specialized to various Java numeric types:

  * `RangeHalfOpenB`
  * `RangeHalfOpenD`
  * `RangeHalfOpenI`
  * `RangeHalfOpenL`
  * `RangeInclusiveB`
  * `RangeInclusiveD`
  * `RangeInclusiveI`
  * `RangeInclusiveL`
